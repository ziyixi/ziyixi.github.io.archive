I am currently a Ph.D. student in **[the Department of Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering (CMSE)](https://cmse.msu.edu/)** of Michigan State University, with the mentor of **[Prof. Min Chen](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/min-chen/)**.
\
\
My research focus are the **computational seismology**, especially for the methods and the applications of performing seismic inversion in supercomputers. I am passionate about contributing to the understanding of the **mechanisms for deep earthquakes**, by analyzing the result from the inverted 3D fine structure earth model.
\
\
I am also interested in the field of **High performance computing** and **Heterogeneous computing**. I am willing to further learn and practice the techinques and implement to the real world applications.
