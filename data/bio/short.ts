I am currently a Ph.D. student in **[the Department of Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering (CMSE)](https://cmse.msu.edu/)** of Michigan State University, with the mentor of **[Prof. Min Chen](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/min-chen/)**.

&nbsp;

My research focus is **computational seismology**, especially for the methods and the applications of performing seismic inversion in supercomputers. I am passionate about contributing to the **mechanisms for deep earthquakes** by analyzing the result from the inverted 3D earth model.

&nbsp;

I am also interested in the field of **High-performance computing** and **Heterogeneous computing**. I am willing to learn further and practice the techniques and implement them in real-world applications.
