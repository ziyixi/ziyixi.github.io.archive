several calculations (several earthquakes)\n# in an embarrassingly-parallel fashion from within the same run;\n# this can be useful when using a very large supercomputer to compute\n# many earthquakes in a catalog, in which case it can be better from\n# a batch job submission point of view to start fewer and much larger jobs,\n# each of them computing several earthquakes in parallel.\n# To turn that option on, set parameter NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS to a value greater than 1.\n# To implement that, we create NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS MPI sub-communicators,\n# each of them being labeled \"my_local_mpi_comm_world\", and we use them\n# in all the routines in \"src/shared/parallel.f90\", except in MPI_ABORT() because in that case\n# we need to kill the entire run.\n# When that option is on, of course the number of processor cores used to start\n# the code in the batch system must be a multiple of NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS,\n# all the individual runs must use the same number of processor cores,\n# which as usual is NPROC in the Par_file,\n# and thus the total number of processor cores to request from the batch system\n# should be NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS * NPROC.\n# All the runs to perform must be placed in directories called run0001, run0002, run0003 and so on\n# (with exactly four digits).\n#\n# Imagine you have 10 independent calculations to do, each of them on 100 cores; you have three options:\n#\n# 1/ submit 10 jobs to the batch system\n#\n# 2/ submit a single job on 1000 cores to the batch, and in that script create a sub-array of jobs to start 10 jobs,\n# each running on 100 cores (see e.g. http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/job_array.html )\n#\n# 3/ submit a single job on 1000 cores to the batch, start SPECFEM3D on 1000 cores, create 10 sub-communicators,\n# cd into one of 10 subdirectories (called e.g. run0001, run0002,... run0010) depending on the sub-communicator\n# your MPI rank belongs to, and run normally on 100 cores using that sub-communicator.\n#\n# The option below implements 3/.\n#\nNUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS     = 1\n\n# if we perform simultaneous runs in parallel, if only the source and receivers vary between these runs\n# but not the mesh nor the model (velocity and density) then we can also read the mesh and model files\n# from a single run in the beginning and broadcast them to all the others; for a large number of simultaneous\n# runs for instance when solving inverse problems iteratively this can DRASTICALLY reduce I/Os to disk in the solver\n# (by a factor equal to NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS), and reducing I/Os is crucial in the case of huge runs.\n# Thus, always set this option to .true. if the mesh and the model are the same for all simultaneous runs.\n# In that case there is no need to duplicate the mesh and model file database (the content of the DATABASES_MPI\n# directories) in each of the run0001, run0002,... directories, it is sufficient to have one
